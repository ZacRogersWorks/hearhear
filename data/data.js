Levi is well-versed in songwriting, engineering, and mixing, and uses a combination of analog and digital equipment to offer a wide range of sonic options to the artist. Levi has great intuition when it comes to songwriting and encourages both structure and experimentation in the recording process. Most importantly, Levi is open-minded and fully supports the artist in fulfilling their creative vision. His end goal is to provide the tools and input to help you get there."',
