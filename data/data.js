      '"Working with Levi has expanded my musical palette and taken my songs to another level. Levi is well-versed in songwriting, engineering, and mixing, and uses a combination of analog and digital equipment to offer a wide range of sonic options to the artist. Levi has great intuition when it comes to songwriting and encourages both structure and experimentation in the recording process. Most importantly, Levi is open-minded and fully supports the artist in fulfilling their creative vision. His end goal is to provide the tools and input to help you get there."',

      ' "Levi was an integral part of our first record at the Sugartank. He helped encourage us to get out of our comfort zone and be open to new ideas, sonically. On The Quiet Riders record, we made the choice to track a great deal of the record to tape, writing in the studio together as band, and I feel the quality of the recordings came out the way they did because Levi’s approach was about capturing a performance, not just hitting record. We tried a lot of different approaches, and he was so game to experiment till we found the sounds we loved. We loved working with levi and are grateful for his detailed approach to our music."',

My favorite part of working with him has not only been his knowledge of the gear and equipment but also his ability to create an open, free environment. He has built an atmosphere at the studio that encourages chasing ideas and trying new things. I will definitely be working with Levi for many more years to come. 5 stars!",
